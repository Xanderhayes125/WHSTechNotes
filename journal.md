In baseball, computer science can be used for calculationg statistics like batting average and other stats in the game. it can also be used for programming the online stuff for when people watch the game live. showing the inning, the amount of outs the score, all of those things. It can also be used for in person views like for the scoreboard. the scoreboards nowadays are fully digital so programming the scoreboard to do what it needs to is apart of computer science as well.

If i were in charge of school, i would lift the phone ban. Phones would be allowed in class and in the halls. kids would be allowed to use headphones as well. as far as AI, AI is a tool that can be used to learn. Realisticlly, AI is used more in the real wolr and at jobs and in science labs than actual handwriten or thought out things. chat GPT would be the main AI tool for my school because its reliable but also programmned to stay appropriate.
