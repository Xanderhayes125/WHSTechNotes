My favorite game to play is Fortnite. The aspects of the game that makes it enjoyable and succesful is that facts that it is a multi-purpose game. Not only is it a 3rd person shooter game, it is also a battle royal game. It also has a survivle game mode called save the world and that is how Fortnite originated. Not only does it have multiple battle royal modes and a survivle mode, but it have a mode called, "Creative mode," which is basicly building your own games and modes inside of Fortnite. Fortnite is most known for its, "live events", which are interactive live events that are implimented into the game to tie into a storyline. However, the most notable trait about Fortnite is, of course, all of its collaberations. Fortnite has collaberated with huge companies like Marvle, DC, Other video games like Halo and even Among Us. It also has collaberations with different celeberties and content creators. The game has something called, "emotes", which are just dances you can do in game. They collaberate with many different people in order to be able to put all the popular dances into the game. Fortnite is truly unique and there is no other game like it.
