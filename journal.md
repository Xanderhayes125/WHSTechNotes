My favorite game to play is Fortnite. The aspects of the game that makes it enjoyable and succesful is that facts that it is a multi-purpose game. Not only is it a 3rd person shooter game, it is also a battle royal game. It also has a survivle game mode called save the world and that is how Fortnite originated. Not only does it have multiple battle royal modes and a survivle mode, but it have a mode called, "Creative mode," which is basicly building your own games and modes inside of Fortnite. Fortnite is most known for its, "live events", which are interactive live events that are implimented into the game to tie into a storyline. However, the most notable trait about Fortnite is, of course, all of its collaberations. Fortnite has collaberated with huge companies like Marvle, DC, Other video games like Halo and even Among Us. It also has collaberations with different celeberties and content creators. The game has something called, "emotes", which are just dances you can do in game. They collaberate with many different people in order to be able to put all the popular dances into the game. Fortnite is truly unique and there is no other game like it.

Precision positivly affects the outcome of a program by making it run a lot more smooth and more exact to how you want it to work. If there are missed steps in a program you could prtencially run into some errors and you won't get the specific outcome you are trying to get. it is important to develope good attention to detail early in the coding journey in order to be able to be more fluent later on rather than trying to figure it out later.

There are a lot of benifits to Ai technology. The biggest benifit to Ai is that Ai is able to make things easier to do and sometimes able to do something for you without you having to do anything. However, Ai can have some risks as well. Ai isnt perfect because it was created by man. Because of this fact, Ai could mess up something crucial and potecially create a lot of problems if done or used incorrectly.

It is important to protect your personal information whne publishing things online because if people get access to your information you could be hacked and they could steal from you. You cand make the things you publish privet or use programs that secure your information so that its harder for people to access it. i once shared my drivers licens to some friends but realized that a lot of my personal information that i didnt want to share was on it so i would think twice before sharing other things. When working with others online you can also stay privet by only allowing certain things to be accessed by the other person or maybe working with that perosn on a different accond that doesnt have your personal information on it.
