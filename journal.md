My favorite game to play is Fortnite. The aspects of the game that makes it enjoyable and succesful is that facts that it is a multi-purpose game. Not only is it a 3rd person shooter game, it is also a battle royal game. It also has a survivle game mode called save the world and that is how Fortnite originated. Not only does it have multiple battle royal modes and a survivle mode, but it have a mode called, "Creative mode," which is basicly building your own games and modes inside of Fortnite. Fortnite is most known for its, "live events", which are interactive live events that are implimented into the game to tie into a storyline. However, the most notable trait about Fortnite is, of course, all of its collaberations. Fortnite has collaberated with huge companies like Marvle, DC, Other video games like Halo and even Among Us. It also has collaberations with different celeberties and content creators. The game has something called, "emotes", which are just dances you can do in game. They collaberate with many different people in order to be able to put all the popular dances into the game. Fortnite is truly unique and there is no other game like it.

Precision positivly affects the outcome of a program by making it run a lot more smooth and more exact to how you want it to work. If there are missed steps in a program you could prtencially run into some errors and you won't get the specific outcome you are trying to get. it is important to develope good attention to detail early in the coding journey in order to be able to be more fluent later on rather than trying to figure it out later.

In my daily life, computer science plays a huge role. The biggest thing that affects my life due to the use of computer science is the technology that i use. i use technology every day throughout the day. without computer science, all the technology that i use wouldn't be able to function proprtly and therefore i'd hate my life.
