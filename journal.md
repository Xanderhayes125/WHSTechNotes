My favorite game to play is Fortnite. The aspects of the game that makes it enjoyable and succesful is that facts that it is a multi-purpose game. Not only is it a 3rd person shooter game, it is also a battle royal game. It also has a survivle game mode called save the world and that is how Fortnite originated. Not only does it have multiple battle royal modes and a survivle mode, but it have a mode called, "Creative mode," which is basicly building your own games and modes inside of Fortnite. Fortnite is most known for its, "live events", which are interactive live events that are implimented into the game to tie into a storyline. However, the most notable trait about Fortnite is, of course, all of its collaberations. Fortnite has collaberated with huge companies like Marvle, DC, Other video games like Halo and even Among Us. It also has collaberations with different celeberties and content creators. The game has something called, "emotes", which are just dances you can do in game. They collaberate with many different people in order to be able to put all the popular dances into the game. Fortnite is truly unique and there is no other game like it.

Precision positivly affects the outcome of a program by making it run a lot more smooth and more exact to how you want it to work. If there are missed steps in a program you could prtencially run into some errors and you won't get the specific outcome you are trying to get. it is important to develope good attention to detail early in the coding journey in order to be able to be more fluent later on rather than trying to figure it out later.

In my daily life, computer science plays a huge role. The biggest thing that affects my life due to the use of computer science is the technology that i use. i use technology every day throughout the day. without computer science, all the technology that i use wouldn't be able to function proprtly and therefore i'd hate my life.

There are a lot of benifits to Ai technology. The biggest benifit to Ai is that Ai is able to make things easier to do and sometimes able to do something for you without you having to do anything. However, Ai can have some risks as well. Ai isnt perfect because it was created by man. Because of this fact, Ai could mess up something crucial and potecially create a lot of problems if done or used incorrectly.

Technology positivly impacts the voting process by making it quicker and more efficiant to get it done. This will make people more eger to vote since the prcess wont take as ong. However, there could be a huge issue with voting digitaly because it could potetially be hacked and could lead to unfair voting.

It is important to protect your personal information whne publishing things online because if people get access to your information you could be hacked and they could steal from you. You cand make the things you publish privet or use programs that secure your information so that its harder for people to access it. i once shared my drivers licens to some friends but realized that a lot of my personal information that i didnt want to share was on it so i would think twice before sharing other things. When working with others online you can also stay privet by only allowing certain things to be accessed by the other person or maybe working with that perosn on a different accond that doesnt have your personal information on it.

Technology has changed the food industry immensly. With technology, people are able to order food online and even have it delivered to you all through an app. This is both benificial and hurtful. This is benificial because you don't have to make extra trips in order to recive and order food. however, this causes people to be fat and over weight because people overuse it and just order non stop without having to even leave the house.

When it comes to Ai i think of chat GPT. Chat GPT is super benificial and very easily accessible in order to assist with anything that you need. Chat GPT can help with notes, calculations, and even just simple tasks. Technology concerns me because as much as chat GPT can hlp, it can also help people cheat, and student who cheat there way to a degree may not know ANYTHING when it comes down to applying the knowledge that they were supposed to learn.

The term brain rot to me means something that you do or say that makes you seem less intelectual mentally than you should be due to the stuff that you see online that may influence your behavior. Depending how you use digital media, it can positivly or negativly impact you. if you watch or invest in things that doesn't have any true value in inteligence or life could potentally be negative. However i do believe that it is possible to balence meaningful and irrelivent usage of ditgital media.

I enjoyed being with my friends but i could improve on doing my work.There isnt anything id like to learn. i am NOT interested in persuing a certification in this class.

I think AI can be very benificial if certain areas but overall i think that humans are more reliable because if you depend souly on AI then when there are technical difficulties youre out of luck. AI can be helpful with calculations and floor planning with construction however wouldn't be very efficient actually building and stuff, which goes for all jobs. So i think learning to work together with AI would be good but completely being replaced could cause major issues later on.

Government intervention impacts technology by restricting use of that certain technology, espicilly with tiktok. I would probably increse security services on tiktok by resricting useage of real names and identity information, while also restricting certain ages from accessing the app.

Air traffic contol systems is probably the biggest one as it relates to this specific situation because had the traffic control system been better or stronger the collision most likey may not have happened. They would have been able to pick up the signal from both planes and warned them ahead of time and completely avoided the collision all together. Software errors and bugs is also a big one. Since air travel relies heavily on technology to ensure safe air travle,it causes great risk to people and airlines when software errors happen because this causes for higher risk of danger and collisions which can have fatal outcomes.

Something interesting i learned last week was how to do a new drill in baseball. The drill was how to play a ball off the wall in the outfield. i found it interesting because ive never done those type of drills before so it was very useful.

Technology can be used to help educators better understand the youth slang by scrolling through social media and finding different slang terms and their meaning in order to better relate to the youth. schools shouldn't teach slang terms because they arent very intelligent terms to use. There are many different ways to say things so i believe that schools should continue to teach the proper termonology for things. this new era of slang terms can be very confussing to adults or older individuals and can cause many misunderstandings. this can harshly impact educators and school staff by hearing something they may believe is bad or wrong but the children may mean something thats good and could lead to unnecessary conflict between them.
